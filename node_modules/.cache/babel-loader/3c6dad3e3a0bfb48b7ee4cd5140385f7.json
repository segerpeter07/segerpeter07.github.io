This project taught me a lot about the power of frequency domain translation as well as provided practical experience in interacting with external APIs.\"), React.createElement(\"span\", {\n        className: \"categories\",\n        __source: {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 257\n        },\n        __self: this\n      }, React.createElement(\"i\", {\n        className: \"fa fa-tag\",\n        __source: {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 257\n        },\n        __self: this\n      }), \"Photography\")), React.createElement(\"div\", {\n        className: \"link-box\",\n        __source: {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 259\n        },\n        __self: this\n      }, React.createElement(\"a\", {\n        href: \"http://www.behance.net\",\n        __source: {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 260\n        },\n        __self: this\n      }, \"Details\"), React.createElement(\"a\", {\n        className: \"popup-modal-dismiss\",\n        __source: {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 261\n        },\n        __self: this\n      }, \"Close\"))), React.createElement(\"div\", {\n        id: \"modal-07\",\n        className: \"popup-modal mfp-hide\",\n        __source: {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 264\n        },\n        __self: this\n      }, React.createElement(\"img\", {\n        className: \"scale-with-grid\",\n        src: \"images/portfolio/modals/m-origami.jpg\",\n        alt: true,\n        __source: {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 265\n        },\n        __self: this\n      }), React.createElement(\"div\", {\n        className: \"description-box\",\n        __source: {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 266\n        },\n        __self: this\n      }, React.createElement(\"h4\", {\n        __source: {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 267\n        },\n        __self: this\n      }, \"Origami\"), React.createElement(\"p\", {\n        __source: {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 268\n        },\n        __self: this\n      }, \"Proin gravida nibh vel velit auctor aliquet.

           One of my largest focuses outside of classes is my work on Olin’s Formula SAE Electric build team. Each year, we design, \n                  build, and race a Formula One style race car from scratch. I have been on the team since starting at Olin. Originally \n                  on the Electrical subteam, I worked on designing and fabricating the dashboard PCB from scratch and writing all the \n                  firmware required for it to initialize the start-up sequence, report speed, and handle multiple safety features. \n                  The next year, I became the firmware lead where I handled all the firmware requirements on 20 custom PCBs and distributed \n                  the workload to ~15 engineers. My role required me to teach the skills to students, maintain a high level of organization, \n                  and meet strict deadlines. During my time as firmware lead, I also wrote a new AVR-C build chain using a Python script to \n                  generate and execute shell commands. This was done in hopes of simplifying our build process for so many boards as well as \n                  make our build chain more modular and easy to expand/modify.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                This year, I have joined the leadership team as the Marketing Manager. My role requires me to secure $65k in sponsorship for our team \n                from corporate sponsors, local sponsors, as well as run a family & friends fundraising campaign. Additional responsibilities \n                include taking photos and video for our social media sites, producing videos to highlight special projects and milestones, and \n                send quarterly update newsletters to all our sponsors. This year, our team struggled with member retention and member’s having \n                value on the team, so I help launch our first team climate survey which provided deep insights into members’ motivations, feelings, \n                and value on the team. Further, we are investigating our team’s unbalanced gender representation in hopes of creating a team for \n                all genders that equally prepares members to excel in the workforce. This is something that I am incredibly passionate about and \n                motivates me to better define our leadership roles and the place we hold on the team in terms of productivity, personal growth, \n                and team culture.\n            </p>\n              <span className=\"categories\"><i className=\"fa fa-tag\" />Leadership, Embedded Firmware, C</span>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"link-box\">\n              <a href=\"http://www.behance.net\">Details</a>\n              <a className=\"popup-modal-dismiss\">Close</a>\n            </div>\n          </div>{/* modal-01 End */}\n          <div id=\"modal-02\" className=\"popup-modal mfp-hide\">\n            <img className=\"scale-with-grid\" src=\"images/portfolio/tae.png\" alt />\n            <div className=\"description-box\">\n              <h4>TAE Furniture</h4>\n              <p>\n                In my second year of undergrad, I helped launch an online business focused on designing and building folding furniture for \n                people living in small spaces such as first time apartment dwellers and students. After developing our business plan and \n                experimenting with product-market fit within our school’s environment, we began a limited first run of our flagship folding chair. \n                As we endeavoured into turning this project into an actual business, I took the role of CEO and managed all the incorporation process, \n                website build-out, and lead our marketing strategies. Through this process, I learned a lot about the legality of starting a business \n                and all the intricacies involved with incorporating a limited liability corp in the state of Delaware. While the business \n                unfortunately did not take off as we had hoped and we were forced to close about a year later, it was an incredible learning \n                experience for all of us and has ignited an entrepreneurial fire within me truly teaching me the value of hustle and hard work.\n              </p>\n              <span className=\"categories\"><i className=\"fa fa-tag\" />CEO, Entrepreneurship</span>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"link-box\">\n              <a href=\"http://www.behance.net\">Details</a>\n              <a className=\"popup-modal-dismiss\">Close</a>\n            </div>\n          </div>{/* modal-02 End */}\n          <div id=\"modal-03\" className=\"popup-modal mfp-hide\">\n            <img className=\"scale-with-grid\" src=\"images/portfolio/paris.jpg\" alt />\n            <div className=\"description-box\">\n              <h4>Peter Seger Photography</h4>\n                <p>\n                    During my limited free time, one of my passions is photography which I have been lucky enough to earn some money from. \n                    In high school, I was able to take senior portraits as well as explore travel and landscape photography. Additionally, \n                    I explored the fascinating genre of sports photography where I was able to study under the mentorship of a professional \n                    sports photographer in Sweden. During this mentorship, I was able to photograph professional soccer, football, and ice \n                    hockey. I now focus on portraiture, landscape, and travel photography.\n                </p>\n              <span className=\"categories\"><i className=\"fa fa-tag\" />Photography, Entrepreneurship</span>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"link-box\">\n              <a href=\"http://www.behance.net\">Details</a>\n              <a className=\"popup-modal-dismiss\">Close</a>\n            </div>\n          </div>{/* modal-03 End */}\n          <div id=\"modal-04\" className=\"popup-modal mfp-hide\">\n            <img className=\"scale-with-grid\" src=\"images/portfolio/strolle.png\" alt />\n            <div className=\"description-box\">\n              <h4>Strolle</h4>\n              <p>\n                As part of a full stack engineering class, I worked as the project manager and engineer for a team project where we built \n                a webapp to design and share walks, hikes, and runs in new cities.

During this class, we went out and interviewed \n                community nurses in a broad range of situations from ICU nurses, nurse practitioners in the university setting, research nurses, \n                and many more. Through our series of interviews, we more narrowly defined community nurses to be ICU nurses which we then worked \n                closely to co-design a solution to a problem we identified. That problem being that nurses felt they were being pulled in two \n                directions: helping patients bedside, and working closely with patients’ families to communicate their patients’ status and \n                provide emotional support. Together with our nurses, we came up with EVE our virtual nurse assistant that would tie into their \n                existing patient tracking software, EPIC, and would provide an AI chatbot for family members to get updates as well as communicate \n                back and forth with the virtual nurse or the real nurse with provided seamless hand-off of communication. This class provided an \n                incredible opportunity for us to identify user groups, work closely with them to get to know them and their problems, and then \n                work together to generate a solution to their idea all while constantly documenting and presenting our findings through journey \n                maps, persona creations, mind maps, and many more industry standard ideation techniques.\n              </p>\n              <span className=\"categories\"><i className=\"fa fa-tag\" />Branding, Webdesign</span>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"link-box\">\n              <a href=\"http://www.behance.net\">Details</a>\n              <a className=\"popup-modal-dismiss\">Close</a>\n            </div>\n          </div>{/* modal-05 End */}\n          <div id=\"modal-06\" className=\"popup-modal mfp-hide\">\n            <img className=\"scale-with-grid\" src=\"images/portfolio/modals/m-girl.jpg\" alt />\n            <div className=\"description-box\">\n              <h4>Fitspot</h4>\n              <p>\n                As part of my Quantitative Engineering course, I worked with a partner to come up with a webapp that produced custom Spotify \n                playlists off of running accelerometer data. Using a smartphone to collect accelerometer data from a run, we built a system that \n                ingests the raw data, performs Fourier frequency analysis on it to identify the frequency of the running motion and convert that \n                to beats per minute (BPM). It then uses the Spotify API to search for song that match the average BPM of the run and adds them \n                to a playlist. This project taught me a lot about the power of frequency domain translation as well as provided practical experience \n                in interacting with external APIs.\n              </p>\n              <span className=\"categories\"><i className=\"fa fa-tag\" />Photography</span>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"link-box\">\n              <a href=\"http://www.behance.net\">Details</a>\n              <a className=\"popup-modal-dismiss\">Close</a>\n            </div>\n          </div>{/* modal-06 End */}\n          <div id=\"modal-07\" className=\"popup-modal mfp-hide\">\n            <img className=\"scale-with-grid\" src=\"images/portfolio/modals/m-origami.jpg\" alt />\n            <div className=\"description-box\">\n              <h4>Origami</h4>\n              <p>Proin gravida nibh vel velit auctor aliquet.
