							<h1>FitSpot</h1>

							<h2>Purpose</h2>
							<p>The purpose of this app is to be able to get a good running or walking playlist without using cellular data. Currently, Spoitfy has a feature that plays songs based on your running pace. However, this requires the use of cellular data, which is not always available or is expensive. With FitSpot, a user can upload accelerometer data from a run and get a Spotify playlist that they can dowload and use on their next run. The intended user-group are runners that do not have access to cellular data regularly when they are running.</p>

								<h2>Data Collection</h2>
								<p>Initially we collected data by going on a run and placing a phone in a tight pocket of a fanny pack. The fanny pack was attached to the waist of the runner. We also collected data by attaching a phone to an arm and going on a run to see if a less standard motion could produce the same results.</p>

								<h2>Data Processing</h2>
								<p>The accelerometer data from the phone is a csv file that needs to be processed to adjusted due to the presence of gravity, it also needs to be arranged into lists of x, y and z axis values.</p>

							<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
							<p>Depending on the orientation of the phone the x or y data was put through a fourier transform. The frequency (besides gravity) with the highest value was taken as the step frequency for steps a second.</p>

								<h2>Results and Validation</h2>
								<p>This frequecny was converted to steps per a minute and then divided by two for BPM. We validated that data by running to the generated playlists and determining that they went really well with our running pace.</p>
