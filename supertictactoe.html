							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>Going into this project both of us wanted to work on something we had no experience in. Networking was a natural choice, so we had to figure out an interactive implementation of networking. Tic tac toe is a classic multiplayer game that was a logical game to use, and we went further to make it a mega tic tac toe game that included some more game-side logic.</p>

							<h2>Implementation</h2>
							<p>The most unique part of this project was undoubtedly its multi-player aspect. From an architecture level, this was implemented most noticibly in the inclusion of two scripts, a server and a client. A copy of the client would run on each machine, but only one server instance should exist. The server script creates a server object from the server class, utilizing it to listen for new connections. Once the socket has been initialized and a client has connected the server creates a new model instance, and the model creates a new user which stores that player's color, as well as whether or not it is their turn. The server then echoes the state of the board back to all connected clients. Once both clients have connected they can begin to play. Upon further attempted connections the server rejects them, giving an appropriate error message.</p>
							<p>The model handles all of the logic of the game, with the clients sending click positions to the server, and the server forwarding them on to the model. Once there, the model checks whether the user that sent the click has the turn or not, and if the square that they clicked is (a) unoccupied and (b) within the box currently in focus. If all of these conditions are met, the clicked square is given the color of the user who clicked on it, and the state matrix** of the board is updated and broadcast to all clients. The clients then take the matrix, decompose it, and draw the correctly positioned (and colored) squares onto their board. Upon a click, the cycle begins again.</p>
							<p>In terms of design decisions, the most critical one was that of having all game-level logic happen on the server side, with the clients essentially being shells that blindly draw data and output click points. We eventually went with the option that we did in order to create as lightweight a program as possible. Before the game concept was fully finalized we were going to make an Asteroids clone, where low latency between computers would have been paramount, so this was prioritized. Although the game we eventually went with was less speed-dependent, the structure stayed. This does make the clients extremely lightweight, a good thing in general.</p>
							<p>**the state matrix is composed of data describing the position of each played box, as well as which box is the "focus"</p>

							<h2>Reflection</h2>
							<p>Overall things went very well. The project was relatively well-scoped, and we were able to complete it in a orderly and educational fashion. That being said, our original goal was overly ambitious (a two-player asteroid-style space arcade game where one user was the pilot of a ship, and the other the gunner). While this project would have been much more intensive, and we would have learned more, it was just too much to do.</p>
							<p>Unit testing on this project was very difficult, as the majority of the issues came from server-client communication. In order to test the system it was necessary to boot the server, run the clients, check three terminals for errors, and usually cycle the whole system. Beyond this more effort could have been put into documenting the code as well as putting in a system of doctests. As it was, the doctests would have taken longer to implement than it took to test the methods by hand due to the inherited nature of the class architecture. In terms of teamwork we worked together well, though more partner worktime earlier on would have probably made integration more easily.</p>
