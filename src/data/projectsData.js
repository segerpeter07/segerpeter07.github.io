Used an existing API in Functional Language (FL) to recreate functionality in C to increase speed, accuracy, and dependability of the tool. Used advanced data structures and heuristics to create informative and accurate schematics from Register Transfer Language (RTL) descriptions."

            "One of my largest focuses outside of classes is my work on Olin’s Formula SAE Electric build team. Each year, we design, build, and race a Formula One style race car from scratch. I have been on the team since starting at Olin. Originally on the Electrical subteam, I worked on designing and fabricating the dashboard PCB from scratch and writing all the firmware required for it to initialize the start-up sequence, report speed, and handle multiple safety features. The next year, I became the firmware lead where I handled all the firmware requirements on 20 custom PCBs and distributed the workload to ~15 engineers. My role required me to teach the skills to students, maintain a high level of organization, and meet strict deadlines. During my time as firmware lead, I also wrote a new AVR-C build chain using a Python script to generate and execute shell commands. This was done in hopes of simplifying our build process for so many boards as well as make our build chain more modular and easy to expand/modify.",
            "In 2018, I joined the leadership team as the Marketing Manager. This role required me to secure $65k in sponsorship for our team from corporate sponsors, local sponsors, as well as run a family & friends fundraising campaign. Additional responsibilities included taking photos and video for our social media sites, producing videos to highlight special projects and milestones, and sending quarterly update newsletters to all our sponsors. During this year, our team struggled with member retention and member’s having value on the team, so I helped launch our first team climate survey which provided deep insights into members’ motivations, feelings, and value on the team. Further, we investigated our team’s unbalanced gender representation in hopes of creating a team for all genders that equally prepares members to excel in the workforce. This is something that I am incredibly passionate about and motivates me to better define our leadership roles and the place we hold on the team in terms of productivity, personal growth, and team culture."

            "In my second year of undergrad, I helped launch an online business focused on designing and building folding furniture for people living in small spaces such as first time apartment dwellers and students. After developing our business plan and experimenting with product-market fit within our school’s environment, we began a limited first run of our flagship folding chair. As we endeavoured into turning this project into an actual business, I took the role of CEO and managed all the incorporation process, website build-out, and lead our marketing strategies. Through this process, I learned a lot about the legality of starting a business and all the intricacies involved with incorporating a limited liability corp in the state of Delaware. Additionally, I learned an incredible amount about product-market fit and the actual feasability of bringing a new product to market including the roll that online advertising has in pushing products successfully to market. While the business unfortunately did not take off as we had hoped and we were forced to close about a year later, it was an incredible learning experience for all of us and has ignited an entrepreneurial fire within me truly teaching me the value of hustle and hard work."
